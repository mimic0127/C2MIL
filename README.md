[![Paper](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paper-ICCV%202025-blue)](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxx)  [![Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-GitHub-black)](https://github.com/mimic0127/C2MIL)  [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)](#license)

Official PyTorch implementation of $C^2$MIL, a **dual-causal graph-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model** designed for **robust and interpretable survival analysis** on whole slide images (WSIs).

---

## üîç Overview

Graph-based MIL is widely used in computational pathology but faces two key challenges:

1. **Semantic Confounding Bias**  
   Variations in staining, sectioning, and scanning introduce irrelevant features that harm generalization.

2. **Topological Noise**  
   Not all subgraphs in WSIs are causally relevant to survival outcomes, leading to biased representations.

To tackle these, we propose **C2MIL**, which synchronizes **semantic and topological causalities** via a dual structural causal model.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Cross-Scale Adaptive Feature Disentangling (CAFD):**  
  Removes trivial semantic confounders via backdoor adjustment, adaptively learning confounders without prior knowledge.

- **Bernoulli Differentiable Subgraph Sampling:**  
  Identifies causal subgraphs within WSIs using a straight-through estimator for robust topology learning.

- **Joint Optimization:**  
  Combines semantic supervision and topological contrastive learning under causal invariance.

- **Generalizable & Interpretable:**  
  Achieves **state-of-the-art survival prediction** while providing interpretable attention heatmaps and adaptive clustering.

## üìä Performance

C2MIL achieves **state-of-the-art C-index** across three TCGA cohorts, with significant improvements in both cross-validation and out-of-distribution generalization.
